👋 I am Yudong Han (*韩 宇栋*), a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science, Peking University. My research interests lie in the fields of neural rendering, software/browser testing, 3d digital human, and high-performance computing on the web (WebGPU).

Currently, I am passionate about optimizing web graphics pipelines and enhancing the efficiency of web-based AI applications.
