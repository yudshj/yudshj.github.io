I am a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science, Peking University, advised by Prof. [Yun Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1hnJ3TgAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests lie in the fields of computer graphics, web intelligence, and high-performance computing on the web. Specifically, I am passionate about optimizing web graphics pipelines and enhancing the efficiency of web-based AI applications.
